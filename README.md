# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

This app functions as a note taking app. The user can use it as a todo list or use it as a mobile notepad.
This app uses express to deploy to a local server/heroku.
Express was a harder concept for me to grasp, but after following the README instructions I felt more comfortable.
